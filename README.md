The Graph files is an open-source project that I did in my data structures class and its ultimate goal is to find the shortestPath in the graph of story nodes and make the graph while checking if it is valid. I also made the HSLAPixels and PNG classes for the overall project to work. (C++)

The storyValidator.py file in Python in the file checks if the data that corresponds to the graph is valid and has the correct number of edges and nodes.
