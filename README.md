The student-distrib files are a sample of my operating systems project code done in C++ and x86. The sys_calls files is where I implemented the system call functions such as execute and halt. The file_sys files is where I implemented thr file system for the uniprocessor operating system. 

The Graph files are a sample of a shortestPath in a graph (story nodes) problem that I had to implement for my data structures class. (C++)

The search.py file in Python is an assignment I worked on for my Artificial Intelligence Class to get different ways of finding goals in a maze.
